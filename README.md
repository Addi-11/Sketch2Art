## Sketch2Art
The project aims to transform a sketch to a coloured painting following a given style (prefarable a famous artist), using pix2pix translation and style transfer techniques.
Project pipeline :
- [ ] Reconstruct image from sketch : pix2pix model implementation
- [ ] Arbitary style transfer : UST implementation
